The School of Information at the University of California, Berkeley seeks applications for multiple Postdoctoral Scholars, in the area of Data Science, at 100% time, to help conduct research, teach in, build, and be an integral part of our web-based Master of Information and Data Science program.

The number of positions varies from semester to semester, depending on the needs of the school. Positions typically start in January, May, and August, and appointments may be renewed based on need, funding, and performance. Due to budget restrictions, no funding is available for visa or relocation expenses.

The position will include teaching sections in our online Master’s program, research collaboration, and participating in the intellectual community at the School and on the Berkeley campus. Research responsibilities include pursuing a self-directed research agenda, presenting current research to the community, and participating in research exchange events. Teaching responsibilities include lecturing, holding office hours, grading, assigning grades, advising students, and preparing course materials. In addition to teaching responsibilities, general duties include: hold office hours, assign grades, advise students, prepare course materials (e.g., syllabus), provide clear and prompt feedback on student work, and maintain the course website with support from the graduate student instructor (GSI). Postdocs are expected to teach up to 8 small sections per year as a Lecturer.


UC Berkeley’s newest school, the School of Information (I School), was created in 1994 to address one of society’s most compelling challenges: the need to organize and make sense of the abundance of information that we can now collect, store, and share without regard for cost or distance. The way we organize, represent, govern, and make sense of this information will shape our ability to achieve public as well as private goals.

The I School educates professionals and scholars to understand the problems and possibilities of information, to develop models of information practice, and to design useful and usable information applications, services, and solutions. This requires insights from diverse fields. Our faculty includes scholars and professionals with deep expertise in information and computer science, social sciences, management, law, design, and policy, as well as related fields.

The I School offers three professional master’s degrees and an academic doctoral degree. Our MIMS program trains students for careers as information professionals and emphasizes small classes and project-based learning. Our MIDS program trains data scientists to manage and analyze the coming onslaught of big data, in a unique high-touch online degree. Our MICS program prepares cybersecurity leaders with the technical skills and contextual knowledge necessary to develop solutions for complex cybersecurity challenges. Our Ph.D. program equips scholars to develop solutions and shape policies that influence how people seek, use, and share information.

Our students and graduates work at well-known Bay Area companies that include Apple, Google, Facebook, Salesforce, Twitter, and LinkedIn, as well as at nonprofits like Kaiser Permanente and established businesses like Wells Fargo and Chevron. Many of our graduates take advantage of the opportunity to get in on the ground floor to create or work for start-ups.
